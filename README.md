# PRNG
While hardware modules exist that use physical phenomena to generate truly random numbers, most computing systems use either hardware or software pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) that produce sequences of values that appear to be random. PRNGs can be initialized to a specific value, allowing the same sequence of (seemingly) random values to be generated repeatedly, which is helpful in program debugging. Most programming languages and operating systems provide a built-in function to generate random numbers uniformly distributed in the range (0, 1); these values then can be either (a) appropriately scaled to yield a desired continuous random function or (b) divided into proportionallysized ranges for discrete random functions.
